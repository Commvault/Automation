Welcome to Commvault Automation documentation!
================================================


Commvault Automation Framework lets you execute commands / operations / testcases automatically in the Commcell Environment.

Automation Framework also provides support to connect and execute commands on remote machines, both via CVD and Credentials.

All the commands are executed on remote machines using **PowerShell** as a medium for **Windows**, and **BASH** for **UNIX**.

For security purposes, many of the operations in the Automation Framework are limited only to users with **master** permissions.

**Administrator / root** access is required for performing any operations / running the Automation Framework, i.e.,
the Automation Framework works best without any issues, when executed on the controller machine with the User Account
that has all privileges.

**NOTE:** PowerShell version **4.0** or above is required for proper operations.

Feel free to reach out to the `team <Dev-Automation@commvault.com>`_ for any issues, concerns, or feedback.
